/*
- `Sync` is a marker trait that allows shared references (`&T`) of a type to be accessed by multiple
threads concurrently. If a type is `Sync`, it implies the type can be safely shared across threads.

- Types like `Arc<T>` and `Mutex<T>` are `Sync`, meaning they are designed to be shared between
threads and provide the necessary synchronization internally to prevent race conditions.

- Unlike `Send`, `Sync` implies that the type can be referenced (not moved) across threads,
meaning the type is safe to be accessed concurrently from multiple threads.

- Most types in Rust implement `Sync` if their data members are also `Sync`. However, types
like `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` are marked `!Sync` because their internal mutability could lead
to unsynchronized mutation if shared between threads.

- Both `Send` and `Sync` traits are marker traits, meaning they donâ€™t contain methods but instead
serve as guarantees to the Rust compiler about thread safety properties.
